Revision history for Perl extension Apache2::UploadProgress

0.2  2006-04-23 23:36
    - Simplified the usage to the point of only needing to call
      one js function from an onsubmit handler in the upload form
    - All support files (js/css/xsl) are automatically Aliased in
      Apache, to the /UploadProgress location (can be altered using
      UploadProgressBaseURI directive in Apache, if you want to
      customize the js/css/xsl files)
    - Simplified Apache configuration by automatically setuping the
      content handler that provides progress updates to
      /UpdateProgress in Apache
    - include an XSL stylesheet to render XML doc in a popup (will
      automatically fall back to plain HTML if XSL transforms not
      supported by browser)
    - Added a public method to register new mime handlers, ->register_mime
    - remove the need for prototype.js from the examples to cut down the
      size of the js support code needed
